# Analysis and Plan for kfizzix-library

This document outlines the plan for analyzing the `kfizzix-library` and developing a comprehensive to-do list, including a thorough test suite.

## High-Level Approach

1.  **Analyze Source Code and Documentation:** Thoroughly review the source code in `kfizzix-library/src/main/kotlin` to understand the API and its implementation. I'll also examine the KDoc comments and the `TODO.md` file to assess the state of the documentation.
2.  **Review Existing Tests:** I will check `kfizzix-library/src/test` to understand the current test coverage.
3.  **Develop a Comprehensive To-Do List:** Based on my analysis, I will create a detailed list of tasks. This will include:
    *   A plan for writing a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
    *   Identifying any potential code redundancies or parts that are not idiomatic Kotlin.
    *   A list of required documentation improvements.
4.  **Execute and Iterate:** I will then begin executing this plan, starting with the most critical items.

## Progress So Far

*   Cloned the `kfizzix-library` repository.
*   Explored the file structure.
*   Read the main `README.md` file.
*   Navigated into the `kfizzix-library` directory.
