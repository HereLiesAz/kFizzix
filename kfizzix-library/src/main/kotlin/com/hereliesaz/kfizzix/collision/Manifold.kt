/**
 * A manifold for two touching convex shapes. Box2D supports multiple types of
 * contact:
 *
 *  * clip point versus plane with radius
 *  * point versus point with radius (circles)
 *
 * The local point usage depends on the manifold type:
 *
 *  * circles: the local center of circleA
 *  * faceA: the center of faceA
 *  * faceB: the center of faceB
 *
 * Similarly, the local normal usage:
 *
 *  * e_circles: not used
 *  * e_faceA: the normal on polygonA
 *  * e_faceB: the normal on polygonB
 *
 * We store contacts in this way so that position correction can account for
 * movement, which is critical for continuous physics. All contact scenarios

 * must be expressed in one of these types. This structure is stored across time
 * steps, so we keep it small.
